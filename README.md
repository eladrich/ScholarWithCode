# Scholar With Code
A simple chrome extension to present the number of available code implementions (via `Papers With Code`) for articles listed on `Google Scholar`.

## Recent Updates
**`2020.06.16`**: First Release

## Why?
Two of the most used tools for me during research are `Google Scholar` and `Papers with Code`, together giving a full view of citations and code implementations.

I've noticed that one thing that I do a lot is to: 

&nbsp; **a)** start from a paper I know, go through the  "Papers that cite this work" page on `Google Scholar` and then 

&nbsp; **b)** for each paper check whether it has a code implementation using `Papers With Code`.

As it is kind of annoying to go back and forth between the two, I've written a small chrome extension that shows whether the paper has code implementation and links to the matching page on `Papers with Code`.


## TODOs
- [ ] Publish to Chrome Web Store
- [ ] Check how to remove permissions to all sites (for some reason requesting permission only to Google Scholar and Papers with Code did not seem to work)
