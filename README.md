A simple chrome extension to present the number of available code implementions (via `Papers With Code`) for articles listed on `Google Scholar`.

## Recent Updates
**`2020.06.24`**: Chrome Extension release

**`2020.06.16`**: First Release


## Why?
Two of the most used tools for me during research are `Google Scholar` and `Papers with Code`, together giving a full view of citations and code implementations.

I've noticed that a thing that I do a lot is to start from a paper I know, go through the  "Papers that cite this work" page on `Google Scholar`, and then for each paper check whether it has a code implementation using `Papers With Code`.

As it is kind of annoying to go back and forth between the two, I've written a small chrome extension that shows whether the paper has code implementation and links to the matching page on `Papers with Code`.
